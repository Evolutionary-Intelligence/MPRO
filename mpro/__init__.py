"""MPRO is a Matrix-based pure-Python library of Population-based Randomized
    Optimization algorithm for complex (e.g., non-linear, non-convex, and
    multi-modality), single-objective, unconstrained, continuous problems.
    Its goal is to provide *high-performance* and *elegant* implementations
    for black-box and derivative-free optimization (BBO/DFO) entirely within
    a *unified*, *standardized*, *easy-to-use* programming interface.
