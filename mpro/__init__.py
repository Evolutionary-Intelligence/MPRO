"""MPRO is a Matrix-based pure-Python library of Population-based randomized
    optimization algorithm for complex (e.g., non-linear, non-convex, and
    multi-modality), single-objective, unconstrained, continuous problems.
    Its goal is to provide *high-performance* and *elegant* implementations
    for derivative-free and black-box optimization entirely within a
    *unified*, *standardized*, *easy-to-use* programming interface.
