"""MPRO is a Matrix-based pure-Python library of Population-based Randomized
    Optimization algorithms for complex (e.g., non-linear, non-convex, and
    multi-modal), single-objective, unconstrained, continuous-space problems.
    Its main goal is to provide *high-performance* and *elegant* algorithmic
    implementations for black-box and derivative-free optimization (BBO/DFO)
    entirely under a *unified*, *standardized*, *easy-to-use* programming
    interface.

    Although this open-source Python library is based on PyPop7, the main
    difference lies on the former seeks to maximize the performance of *batch*
    evaluations and update of randomized population.
